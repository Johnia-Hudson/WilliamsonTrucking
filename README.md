# WilliamsonTrucking

The Trifocals, Jadin Springfield, Johnia Hudson, and Amaya Williamson 

We chose our color theme because our client did not like the original colors that he had on his business card. He told us to be creative, and as a group we all decided on a blueish color, but Amaya wanted a darker blue and Jadin wanted a light blue. Johnia made a statement that we should compromise and that is what we did. So, that is how we agreed on our color theme. 

 

The responsiveness of our page took the longest because the media queries were not working. Eventually we got someone to come and help us with working with viewports and screen sizes.  


What did each of you work on?
