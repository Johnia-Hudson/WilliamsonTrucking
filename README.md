The Trifocals, Jadin Springfield, Johnia Hudson, and Amaya Williamson 

We chose our color theme because our client did not like the original colors that he had on his business card. He told us to be creative, and as a group we all decided on a blueish color, but Amaya wanted a darker blue and Jadin wanted a light blue. Johnia made a statement that we should compromise and that is what we did. So, that is how we agreed on our color theme. 

 

The responsiveness of our page took the longest because the media queries were not working. Eventually we got someone to come and help us with working with viewports and screen sizes.  


What did each of you work on?

The responsiveness of our page took the longest because the media queries were not working. Eventually we got someone to come to help us with working on viewports and screen sizes. This made an enormous difference to the production because we were stuck on the media queries. Then when we converted it over to GitHub (the website that we use to submit our website), it stopped working again. We continued to troubleshoot, eventually we worked out that we needed to change the amount of pixels that were originally used. 

 

Our team has had different perspectives on a lot of things, but in the end we always came up with a solution. At first we didn't know each other. Now we've become closer through teamwork and newfound friendships.
